# erhan_bms
 IoT Based BMS Design

Erhan_bms is designed as main board for modular battery management sytems. It has many feautes plus wlan connectivity that enables IoT applications as well. I have designed it during my erasmus time at Berlin Beuth University as master thesis. All details can be found in my thesis doc. Ps. Tehere is one hardware bug thus gate pins for mosfet switches has to be connected to other gpios. This rework can be seen from the pictures.
